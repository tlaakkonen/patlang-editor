This is an visual editor that is based on the pattern language described in the paper ["A Pattern Language for Machine Learning Tasks" (Rodatz et al., 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02424). You can use it to:
* Describe machine learning tasks by writing diagrammatic equations, 
* Generate Python code that describes the appropriate loss function, 
* Train models on MNIST live in the browser using Tensorflow.js. 

A few examples from the paper (classifiers, autoencoders, and manipulators) are included as examples. 

### Basic Usage

The interface is based around a canvas and a palette, from which items can be dragged. The palette is divided into:

* Boxes, which represent data, output values, and computations, either learnable or fixed, that apply to wires.
* Wires, which represent values. These have types that are determined by their color.
* Diagrams, that can assembled on the canvas from boxes and wires.
* Equations, which are built by equating a pair of diagrams with compatible outputs.

The end goal is that a loss function is generated which encodes these diagrammatic equations, and it can either be downloaded as PyTorch code, or trained in the browser on the MNIST dataset using Tensorflow.js


### Development
- Run dev server: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build`
